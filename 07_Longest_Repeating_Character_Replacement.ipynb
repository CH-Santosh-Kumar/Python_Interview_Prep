    "# Problem 07 : Longest Repeating Character Replacement\n",
    "### You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.\n",
